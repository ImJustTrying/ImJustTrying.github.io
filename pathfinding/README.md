# Pathfinder
This repository hosts the code for an in-browser pathfinding and maze generation visualizer.
```index.html``` and ```pathfinding.css``` host UI code, the ```ts/`` directory hosts the typescript code, and ```js`` the compiled javascript.
This project uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
All other code is written from scratch.
