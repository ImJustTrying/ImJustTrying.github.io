There is a bug where, when the user clicks a special vertex and places it back in the same place,
the icon for the special vertex is invisible -- it is in the correct place in the state. Also,
there are issues again with resizing and zooming -- again, icons are in the correct places (it
seems), but icons are not being drawn.
